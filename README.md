# Dot Game

My solution to a coding expercie to build a game where dots move from the top to the bottom of the screen. A player tries to click
on the dots, and receives points when they are successful. The smaller the dot, the larger the amount of points earned.

The game was supposed to take a few hours to build, and I suspect they expected the solution to use the dom. Since I was spending my free time on this excercise, I thought it would be fun to use this as an excuse to learn more about canvas, so for my solution, the game is rendered in a canvas element.

I'm pretty happy with the results, but didn't receive any feedback on my solution, which they said means it passed.
